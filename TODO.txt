[3] "TODO_TITLE" (00/00/0000) exoad

                i18n,frontend

[3] "Implement animations for right_menu  (12/22/2024) exoad

        Targets:
                frontend,job_dispatching

        Description:
                Currently, when job instances are inserted into the
                global job stack, they just appear on the right menu
                without a smooth transition which can be kind of odd
                to look at. Implement a safe way to handle these
                animations as previous attempts have resulted in
                graphical artifacting.

        Progress:
                ACTION_NAME     |       ACTION_TIMESTAMP

                (12/20/2024)
                Failed implementation using the flutter_animate
                package, but instead produced hella artifacts, such as
                the background of the job instance lagging behind.
